If you want to try Windows Trust 4.5, you will need to download an iso file that contains the installation image of the operating system. You can use a torrent client such as uTorrent to download the iso file from various sources on the internet[^1^]. However, be careful when downloading files from unknown or untrusted sources, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
 
Once you have downloaded the iso file, you will need to burn it to a CD or DVD using a software such as ImgBurn or Nero. Alternatively, you can use a tool such as Rufus or WinToFlash to create a bootable USB drive from the iso file. Then, you can boot your computer from the CD, DVD or USB drive and follow the instructions on the screen to install Windows Trust 4.5 on your hard drive.
 
Windows Trust 4.5 is not an official product of Microsoft and is not supported by them. It is a fan-made project that may have some bugs or compatibility issues. Therefore, use it at your own risk and make sure to backup your important data before installing it.
  
One of the features that Windows Trust 4.5 offers is the device health attestation and conditional access capabilities. These features are used to grant access to corporate resources based on the identity and security status of the device[^1^]. Conditional access evaluates identity signals such as passwords, biometrics, certificates or tokens to confirm that users are who they say they are before they're granted access to corporate resources. Device health attestation checks the device's compliance with security policies such as encryption, antivirus, firewall or updates. If the device is not compliant, it can be blocked or remediated before accessing corporate resources.
 
This way, Windows Trust 4.5 provides a zero trust approach to device security, which means that no device is trusted by default and every device must prove its identity and health before accessing corporate resources. This helps to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches and malware infections that can compromise the security and productivity of the organization.
  
Another feature that Windows Trust 4.5 offers is the automatic update of trusted and untrusted root certificates. Root certificates are used by Windows and applications to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital certificates that are issued by certificate authorities (CAs). Trusted root certificates are those that are recognized and trusted by Windows, while untrusted root certificates are those that are known to be fraudulent or compromised.
 
Windows Trust 4.5 automatically downloads the latest lists of trusted and untrusted root certificates from the Windows Update site every day. These lists are called certificate trust lists (CTLs) and they contain the information about the root certificates that Windows should trust or distrust. By updating the CTLs regularly, Windows Trust 4.5 ensures that the system is protected from malicious or invalid certificates that can compromise the security and privacy of the users and the organization[^2^].
 
A third feature that Windows Trust 4.5 offers is the support for forest trust relationships with Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS). Azure AD DS is a cloud-based service that provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, Kerberos and NTLM authentication. Forest trust relationships enable access to resources across multiple domains or forests in Active Directory.
 
Windows Trust 4.5 can create a one-way transitive forest trust with Azure AD DS, which means that the managed domain in Azure AD DS will trust other domains in Windows Trust 4.5, but not vice versa. This allows users in Windows Trust 4.5 to access resources in Azure AD DS, such as applications, files or printers, without having to create separate accounts or passwords[^3^]. This also simplifies the management and administration of the hybrid environment, as well as enhances the security and compliance of the organization.
